Creating a new JavaScript game is a daunting task for someone 
who is only learning how to use Javascript.

The psuedocode is very simple and can be improved. It was the easiest way
for me to divide the task into sub tasks.

As I progress on my journey I will definitely learn to write better psuedocode.

After struggling to figure out why I keep getting incorrect values returned
I dug a little deeper and found I was calling the function twice and getting
wrong results because of that.

Debugging is a skill on it's own
A very valuable one at that

After struggling through a couple of hours of debugging
Finally the program started working

the debugging continued and the final product is the result 
of a lot of google searches and videos about operators and functions

Coming back to the RPS game after delving deeper into some JS made it somewhat problematic.
I kept trying to find a solution on how to add event listeners and how to connect them to the current code.
I then decided to scrap the code and start over.
hence the code looks entirely different than the initial commits.

Figuring out how to end the game when the scores reached 5 was a nightmare.
Trial and error helped but hopefully in the future I'll be able to solve the 
problem quicker.
